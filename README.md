## 📝 Purpose

This repo is a guess the capital city game. The program uses a JSON file to handle the countries, their capitals, difficulty and continent. The program then takes in the continent as an input to then give the user random countries from that continent. They score points based on the difficulty when giving a correct answer and once they have answered all countries in that continent, the game ends and the user is told thier score.

## 🔮 Future Changes

- Add a leaderboard to view top scores. It will list names and dates acheived 🔜
- Allow the user to select all continents as an option or a select few 🔜
- Make the experience more aesthetically appealing. Perhaps using tabulate or another imported module 🔜
- Make sure the user can only choose a valid continent and prompt them till they do so ✅
- Change the UI so it says ``pass`` if the user doesn't input and ``wrong`` if the user does input something, but not the correct answer 🔜
